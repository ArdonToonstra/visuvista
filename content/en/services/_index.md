# Our Work Process
process:
  title: "Our Work Process"
  description: "From scanning to visualization: 6 phases for perfect results"
  phases:
    - number: 1
      title: "Phase 1: 3D Scanning (Current State)"
      description: "We start on-site to measure the entire property and garden with 3D scanners, resulting in a 'Point Cloud' - an extremely accurate digital copy of the current state."
    - number: 2
      title: "Phase 2: 3D Modeling (Existing 'As-Is')"
      description: "The Point Cloud is processed into an accurate 3D 'As-Is' model. This model serves as the foundation for the new design and prevents misunderstandings due to measurement errors."
    - number: 3
      title: "Phase 3: 3D Modeling (New 'To-Be')"
      description: "Based on the 'As-Is' model, the new situation is designed. All specifications are processed: walls digitally removed, extensions modeled, new stairs and complete garden and pool design."
    - number: 4
      title: "Phase 4: Preliminary Presentation"
      description: "On-site review moment: we walk through the 3D model together to check that all changes have been implemented correctly before final rendering."
    - number: 5
      title: "Phase 5: Visualization, Atmosphere & Lighting"
      description: "When the 'To-Be' model is ready, final materials, global lighting and extra atmosphere are added for photorealistic visualizations."
    - number: 6
      title: "Phase 6: Final Presentation"
      description: "Final feedback round on-site for details and material choices, followed by definitive delivery with high-quality photorealistic renders."
